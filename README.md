## Installation

The mods downloaded from the **Requirements** section are just pre-requisites. To get the actual NijiEN-relevant origins, you still need to install this datapack.

### Single Player

  * On the latest entry, click on **Assets** and click on **nijien_origins.zip**
* Open Minecraft 1.17.1
* Create new world
  * In the "Create New World" screen, click on the <kbd>Data Packs</kbd> button
  * Drag the NijiEN Origins zip file into the game window
    * (Alternatively, you can **Open Pack Folder** and copy it there)
  * Enable the datapack by clicking on its icon
    * It should move to the right side, under "**Selected**"
  * Continue creating the world with your preferences
* If it starts with an Origin Selection screen, then it works.
